## Introduction

UBC Botanical Garden is advancing action for adaptation through the development of community-based adaptation plans with the Sustainable Communities Field School. Ensuring the long-term preservation and sustainable utilization of apple genetic diversity across Canada is of paramount importance. This collaborative initiative aims to inventory and understand existing apple genetic diversity within the country. Additionally, it seeks to investigate how the suitability of habitats for apples may be affected by changing climatic conditions and emerging challenges. In response to these potential impacts, the project aims to identify urgent and longer-term adaptation strategies necessary for the continued resilience of apple populations in Canada.

This work is associated with a in-progress manuscript on *Malus* crop wild relatives (CWR) that are native to Canada, including *M. coronaria* (Sweet Crabapple) and *M. fusca* (Pacific Crabapple).  

The following analysis was written in R, a free programming language and software environment primarily used for statistical computing and graphics. Visit <https://www.r-project.org/> to get started with using R. Also recommended is the use of RStudio, a integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It provides a user-friendly interface for writing code, viewing plots and data, managing files, and installing packages. Once R is installed, visit <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/> to download RStudio. 

The species distribution modeling in the following analysis also requires that you have Java (another free programming language) installed. Visit <https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/java/technologies/downloads/> and install the Java Development Kit (JDK).

**Please note:** The following is a reproducible example, and is not  intended to be a introductory tutorial of SDM. The markdown is written for someone with intermediate to advanced experience in R. 

## Analysis Overview

The following is a reproducible workflow for the development of species distribution models (SDMs), using presence/background occurrence data for *M. coronaria* and *M. fusca* crabapple tree species. This data will be explained in more detail bellow. Occurrence data will be downloaded from the open source Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). There are several types of SDMs, however in this workflow we use the widely adopted Maxent (Maximum Entropy), a machine learning algorithum which can handle presence/background data. The outputs of this analysis are models of predicted habitat suitability of **fundamental niches** from environmental (climate) data. These models predict suitable from historical (1970s-2000s), to future projected climate conditions due to climate change under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). This is essential for understanding how these species may respond to changes in climate, so that they can be better managed, sampled, or conserved for the preservation of these species genetic diversity for future generations. 

See the following for a introduction and description of Maxent: Elith, J., Phillips, S. J., Hastie, T., Dud√≠k, M., Chee, Y. E., & Yates, C. J. (2011). A statistical explanation of MaxEnt for ecologists. Diversity and distributions, 17(1), 43-57. <https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2010.00725.x>.

Here is a brief overview of the steps and associated scripts for each part of the analysis.

7| `sdm_plot.R` | Produce publication quality plots of SDM predictions

## GBIF Species Occurrences Download

The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) is a valuable resource for SDM due to its extensive collection of biodiversity data from around the world. There are several sources of occurrences, such as research and herbarium collections and community science observations. Note that this data is **presence-only** data, meaning there is no information about the **absence** of species. Also, all occurrences are **research grade** meaning they are expert verified identifications or several community members agree on identification.

**NOTE:** You need to have a GBIF user profile, visit <https://www.gbif.org/> to sign up!

Load libraries
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # data management, grammar
library(rgbif) # access GBIF data
```
Initiate user profile information. Note that I have redacted my own information.
```{r eval=FALSE}
# GBIF user info
user='REDACTED'
pwd='REDACTED'
email='REDACTED'
```
Navigate to <https://www.gbif.org/> and search your taxon of interest to get the taxon key identifier. In this case the taxon keys are: *M. coronaria* = 3001166 and *M. fusca* = 3001080.

For the purposes of this workflow I will only show the code for one of the species. Code is just replicated for the other species.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# M. coronaria download 
taxonKey <- 3001166
basisOfRecord <- c('PRESERVED_SPECIMEN', 'HUMAN_OBSERVATION', 'OCCURRENCE') # excluded living specimens and material samples (germplasm)
hasCoordinates <- TRUE # limit to records with coordinates
```
**NOTE:** We do not limit the year of observation in our data collection. There are reasons why you might. However, for the purposes of this analysis it is reasonable to include all observations. Because the main reason why more historical occurrences may be missing today (or say post 1970) is more likely to be due to habitat destruction, rather than changes in climate affecting realized niches. Furthermore, crabtrees are slow growing, and migrate even slower, thus their distribution are *likely* lagging behind changes in their fundamental niches. This highlights the importance of understanding the ecology of your species of interest.

Prepare a download request for the GBIF occurrence data. There are several formats, I choose `.csv` because it is familiar and easy to work with.

```{r}
# Download data
# Use 'pred()' if there is a single argument, or 'pred_in()' if there are multiple
down_code = rgbif::occ_download(
  pred("taxonKey", taxonKey),
  pred_in("basisOfRecord", basisOfRecord),
  pred("hasCoordinate", hasCoordinates),
  format = "SIMPLE_CSV",
  user=user, pwd=pwd, email=email)
```

Download and save the GBIF occurrence data as a `.csv`.
```{r}
getwd() # check your working directory (wd)
setwd("./occ_data/") # set wd to a location where you want to save the csv file.
download_coronaria <- occ_download_get(down_code[1], overwrite = TRUE)
# extract csv from zipper folder and save as clearly named csv in excel or equivalent.

gbif_cor <- read.csv(file = "occ_coronaria.csv") # load named csv data
```
**NOTE:** It is good practice to keep this `.csv` as a 'raw' data file, and manipulate it within the R environment in following workflow rather than make changes to the raw file.

## Clean Species Occurrence Data
Now we have downloaded all observations from GBIF for *M. coronaria* and *M. fusca* that fit a set of defined criteria suitable for our research question. In this case the criteria are limited to species-level taxonomic resolution, that come from preserved herbarium specimens, human observation (i.e. iNaturalist) and research collections documenting species occurrences, all of which are geo-referenced (i.e. geographic coordinates). Also note that we do not limit the geographic location of occurrences, *yet*. At the time of downloading this data (02/14/2024) *M. coronaria* had 1373 records, and *M. fusca* had 2282 records.

As eluded to above, we now need to make some more choices about what species occurrences are appropriate to include and from where. Thus, we must **clean the species occurrence** data. To do this we are going to visually inspect the species occurrences as well as take advantage of R packages such as `CoordinateCleaner` to assist in removing spurious occurrences replicates, those with poor referencing such located in the center of a country or in a body of water, etc.

Load Libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse) # grammar, data management
library(CoordinateCleaner) # helpful functions to clean data
library(terra) # working with vector/raster data
library(geodata) # download basemaps
library(scales) # alpha adjust colours
```

We begin with loading the saved `.csv` files of species occurrences from the last script.
```{r}
# set wd
getwd()
setwd("../occ_data/") # use relative path to open from folder where .csv is saved

# load occurrence csv files
gbif_cor <- read.csv(file = "occ_coronaria.csv") # load coronaria data
gbif_fusca <- read.csv(file = "occ_fusca.csv") # load fusca data
```
Now we want to initiate a `data.frame` and select coluomns that are useful from the `.csv` files. At the same time as we build this `data.frame` we also are going to use several functions to filter occurrences out of the 'cleaned' data set. For more information on the functions used see the library documentation of `CoordinateCleaner`. Also see <https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/gbif-filtering-guide/> for a great blog post published by GBIF on post-processing GBIF downloads. 

```{r}
# filter M. corornia data
occ_cor <- gbif_cor %>% 
  filter(countryCode %in% c('US', 'CA')) %>% # limit to CA and US (their native)
  filter(!is.na(decimalLongitude)) %>% # remove records w/o coords
  filter(coordinateUncertaintyInMeters < 30000 | is.na(coordinateUncertaintyInMeters)) %>% # remove records with high uncertainty in coordinates
  cc_cen(buffer = 2000) %>% # remove records within 2km of country centroids
  cc_inst(buffer = 2000) %>% # remove records within 2km of herbariums, botanical gardens, and other institutions 
  cc_sea() %>% 
  distinct(decimalLatitude, decimalLongitude, speciesKey, datasetKey, .keep_all = T) %>%
  filter(decimalLongitude >= -100) %>% # remove some records on west coast, two from bot gardens (visually verified)
  dplyr::select(species, countryCode, decimalLatitude, 
         decimalLongitude, coordinateUncertaintyInMeters, year, basisOfRecord
         )
```
After filter the occurrences we are left with 932 occurrences for *M. coronaria* and 1205 occurrences for *M. fusca*.

**NOTE:** I am using piper operators (`%>%`) from the tidyverse ecosystem to assist in the ease of data processing. It sequentially applies each argument or function to the `data.frame`, and so be careful in what order you specify functions.   

Now we will save the `data.frame` object as a Rdata file. Rdata files are the best way to store/load data within the R enviroment. We will rutinely save intermediate data files to help speed up analysis of downstream workflow, so that results can be stored rather than having to be repeated every time.
```{r}
getwd() # check what directory you are in
setwd('../occ_data/')

saveRDS(occ_cor, file = "occ_cor.Rdata") # name the file with the .Rdata file extension
```
Now when revisiting an analysis you can reload the saved cleaned dataframe rather than re-running the cleaning functions which are slow computations.
```{r eval=TRUE}
setwd('./occ_data/')
occ_cor <- readRDS(file = "occ_cor.Rdata") # read in the saved .Rdata object 
head(occ_cor) # take a peak at your dateframe 
```

Early I mentioned that we are not limiting the years in which species occurrences are recorded, however it is still important to verify that this decision is not adding 'weird' bias to the data. To do this I am going to split the occurrences in to two dateframes pre and post 1970. This date is commonly associated with when changes in significant changes in global climate began. If occurrences from pre-1970 are vastly different in geography, then we may feel uncomfortable including them in the analysis. 

```{r}
# compare pre/post 1970 occurrences
occ_fus_pre <- occ_fus %>% 
  filter(year < 1970)

occ_fus_post <- occ_fus %>% 
  filter(year >= 1970)
```
The best way to compare these pre/post occurrences, is by visualizing them to detect any differences in spatial coordinates. To do this we need to utilize the `terra` and `geodate` packages. The `terra` package is useful for working with Raster data and will frequently be used throught this workflow. The `geodata` package will also be used frequently, and allows easy download of geographic boundaries from Global Administrative Areas (GADM).

For now plotting will be done using base R `graphics` and `terra`, final publication quality plots will be done later using `ggplot2`. 

```{r}
# M coronaria
plot(canUS_map, xlim = c(-100, -60), ylim = c(25, 50))
# plot Malus coronia occurrences
# pre-1970
points(occ_cor_pre$decimalLongitude, occ_cor_pre$decimalLatitude, pch = 16,
       col = alpha("red", 0.2))
# post-1970
points(occ_cor_post$decimalLongitude, occ_cor_post$decimalLatitude, pch = 16,
       col = alpha("blue", 0.2))

legend(x= -75,
       y = 33,
       title = 'M. coronaria',
       legend = c('Pre-1970 (n=416)', 'Post-1970 (n=516)'), # use nrow() to check how many occurrences are in each data frame.
       fill = c('red', 'blue'))

dev.off() # close graphics plot window
```

**NOTE:** Plotting geographic coordinates can be tricky, and often you will have to play around with the plot limits and legend location to get it to something that is visually appealing.

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width= '600px'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("C:/Users/terre/Documents/UBC/Botanical Garden/Malus Project/maps/occurences/m_coronaria_pre_post_1970.jpeg"))
```

Inspecting the plot of *M. coronria* occurrences there is a large amount of overlap between occurrences from pre and post 1970, thus we feel comfortable keeping all the data no matter the year in the analysis. It is important you evaluate this for your own species and ask if it fits your research question. 

After visually inspecting the occurrence locations, verifying that there are no duplicates, and no occurrences from strange locations (such as records from the west coast, when dealing with an east coast species) you can save your occurrence `data.frame` (e.g. `occ_cor`) for downstream analysis.

## Thinning Occurence Data
So we have downloaded and cleaned the occurrence data for *M. coronaria* and *M. fusca* however we still need to do more processing before we can move producing the SDM. We mush now deal with sampling bias in the occurrences. Sampling bias is an issue because with presence-only data it is hard to distinguish if species are being detected because it is truly preferred habitat, or whether those are just the locations that have been sufficiently sampled. This issue can be (partially) addressed by **thinning** records, so that multiple records from the same are represented by only one (or sometimes a few) occurrence sample. This method is imperfect, but does start to deal with some biases in the spatial representation of the data. 

There are several methods for thinning occurrence records; some more sophisticated then others. A simple approach, and the one used in this workflow is randomly sampling a **single occurrence** per grid cell in the predictor raster (in this case the climate variables).


```{r}
# Load libraries
library(tidyverse) # Grammar and data management 
library(terra) # Working with spatial data
library(geodata) # Basemaps and climate data
```

Start by loading the cleaned species occurrence data saved in the `.Rdata` file we made in the `occ_clean` script.

```{r}
setwd("../occ_data/")
occ_cor <- readRDS(file = "occ_cor.Rdata")
```

When working with spatial data it is important to make sure that different data sources share the same coordinate reference system (a.k.a. projection). We are going to be using climatic data from WorldClim as our predictor raster layers, which is projected using the common WGS84 projection. In order to make sure that the coordinates of occurrences line up accurately within the grid cells of the WorldClim data we are going to create a `SpatVector` object using `terra::vect` and specify the `crs` argument so that it knows to project as WGS84. 

```{r}
occ_cor <- vect(occ_cor, geom = c('decimalLongitude', 'decimalLatitude'),
                crs = "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84")
```

Now we are going to download the WorldClim predictor rasters. WorldClim is a global data set of bioclimatic variables commonly used in ecological research, particular in SDM workflows. Variables in this data set represent a comprehensive set of climatic conditions, including tempature seasonality, perciptication in wettest/driest months and temperature extremes. See <https://www.worldclim.org/data/bioclim.html> for a complete list of all 19 bioclimatic variables included.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** These downloads are large (several thousand Mb), so if you are working in a GitHub repository make sure to add these files to the `.gitignore` file to make sure copies are not sent to the repo.

I like to create a seperate file for WorldClim data, it makes workflow easier to follow and more reproducible. Create a folder within the head of the project.
```{r}
setwd("../wclim_data/")
# Note DO NOT PUSH wclim data**
wclim <- worldclim_global(var = 'bio', res = 2.5, version = '2.1', path = "../wclim_data/")

```
**NOTE:** Climate data is available at several resolutions (size of grid cells) ranging from 10 - 0.5 minutes of degree. In this workflow we opted to go with 2.5 arc-mins (approx. 5 km) as it provides a compromise in the fine-scale of the cell size and practical computation time. 

```{r}
# plot a raster layer to check it downloaded properly
plot(wclim$wc2.1_2.5m_bio_1, main = 'Annual Mean Temperature')
```

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width= '600px'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("C:/Users/terre/Documents/UBC/Botanical Garden/Malus Project/maps/wclim/wclim_bio1.jpeg"))
```

Now we have vectorized occurrence data and rasterised predictor variables, it is time to thin the occurrences data. We will use the `terra::spatSample()` function to take a random sample of a single occurrence per raster cell.

```{r}
set.seed(1337) # set random generator seed to get reproducible results

# M. coronaria thinning
occ_cor <- spatSample(occ_cor, size = 1, 
                      strata = wclim) # sample one occurrence from each climatic cell
```
And like last time, we will save this thinned data as a `.Rdata` file for futher downsteam analysis. **NOTE:** that I call this file a slightly different name, so that I know it is the thinned points.

```{r}
setwd("../occ_data/")
saveRDS(occ_cor, file = 'occThin_cor.Rdata')
```

## Backgroud (bg) Point Sampling
In the Analysis Overview I mentioned in passing that this is a presence/background SDM workflow. Presence/background data sets are cases in which occurrence data is presence-only (like on GBIF), meaning there is no information about the absence of species. This is an important distinction because if we are going to appropriately interpret results, we need to understand the model assumptions. In the presence/background workflow, background (bg) points are randomly sampled from the environment surrounding and overlapping known presence points (more discussion on bg sampling bellow). This effectively samples the distribution of the 'background' environment across your study extent. The Maxent modeling workflow uses this background data to make inferences about absence points, using Baye's Rule. Thus this workflow produces similar results to those as if you were modeling a presence/absence data set (but if presence/absence data is available, use it!). 

See the following for more on background points: Elith, J., Phillips, S. J., Hastie, T., Dud√≠k, M., Chee, Y. E., & Yates, C. J. (2011). A statistical explanation of MaxEnt for ecologists. Diversity and distributions, 17(1), 43-57. <https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2010.00725.x>.


So just exactly what is the background area and how can you define a study extent? Should it be simply the convex hull around occurrences? Or should it be all of North America? This depends entirely on the spatial distribution and scale of your data, model assumptions you are willing to live with, and ecological first principles depending on the life histories of your key species and research question. **NOTE:** Any decision you make will create assumptions and introduce spatial biases to the analysis, and therefore affect the interpretation and predictions of your SDMs. 

See the following citation for in depth discussion on defining study extent: Barve, N., Barve, V., Jim√©nez-Valverde, A., Lira-Noriega, A., Maher, S. P., Peterson, A. T., ... & Villalobos, F. (2011). The crucial role of the accessible area in ecological niche modeling and species distribution modeling. Ecological modelling, 222(11), 1810-1819. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2011.02.011>.

One approach to defining study extent identified by Barve, et al. (2011), is by limiting the background to Biotic regions (hereafter, ecoregions). In short, this method allows for a compromise between real-world biology of species and model tractability. In this workflow I am using North American Ecoregions, as defined by an Internatial collaboration (between Canada, Mexico and the United States) known as the Commission for Environmental Cooperation. Ecoregions are defined at three  Levels (I, II and III) or sptail scales, and are available open source at <https://www.epa.gov/eco-research/ecoregions-north-america>. Choose an appropriate scale for your research question.   

In this workflow I opted to go with the Level-II ecoregions, as this scale compromise the scale at which sets of environmental conditions and biogeography are grouped together while still covering relatively large spatial areas that span across NA.

```{r}
# Load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(terra) 
library(predicts)
library(geodata)
library(ENMTools)
```

Due to the large size of the raster files, I have saved a local copy to my machine, and will not push these fills to the GitHub repo. 
```{r}
ecoNA <- vect(x = "C:/Users/terre/Documents/UBC/Botanical Garden/Malus Project/maps/eco regions/na_cec_eco_l2/", layer = 'NA_CEC_Eco_Level2')
ecoNA <- project(ecoNA, 'WGS84') # project ecoregion vector to same coords ref as basemap
```
**NOTE:** I project the ecoregion rasters the same CSR as the climate predictor rasters. 

Let's take a look at the ecoregions (plotted in red), over top of North America.
```{r}
# download/load maps
getwd()
setwd('../occ_data/')
us_map <- gadm(country = 'USA', level = 1, resolution = 2,
               path = "../occ_data/base_maps") #USA basemap w. States

ca_map <- gadm(country = 'CA', level = 1, resolution = 2,
               path = '../occ_data/base_maps') #Canada basemap w. Provinces

canUS_map <- rbind(us_map, ca_map) #combine US and Canada vector map

# plot basemap
plot(canUS_map, xlim = c(-180, -50))
# plot ecoregions 
lines(ecoNA, col = 'red')

dev.off()
```


```{r, eval = TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width= '600px'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("C:/Users/terre/Documents/UBC/Botanical Garden/Malus Project/maps/eco regions/eco_region_projection_NA.jpeg"))
```

Now lets load our thinned occurrences from the `occ_thin.R` script.

```{r}
# load occurrence data
setwd("../occ_data/")
occThin_cor <- readRDS(file = 'occThin_cor.Rdata')
```

Now that we have the eco regions and occurrence points loaded, lets load the WorldClim predictor rasters. We want to mask and crop these predictor layers to the ecoregions. This will defined the study extent, and subsquently allow us to sample the background. 

First we need to know which of the level-II ecoregions are known to have species occurrences. To do this we will make use of the function `terra::extract`. **NOTE:** It could take a few mins for the extraction to complete 

```{r}
# M. coronaria ecoregions 
# extract ecoregion polygon that contain M. coronaria occurrence points
eco_cor <- extract(ecoNA, occThin_cor) # extract what polygons contained points 

# return vector of eco region codes of the polygons that contain occurrences
eco_cor_code <- eco_cor$NA_L2CODE %>% unique() 
eco_cor_code <- eco_cor_code[eco_cor_code != '0.0']  #remove the 'water' '0.0' ecoregion

# CODES: "8.1" "8.2" "5.3" "8.4" "8.3" "9.4" "8.5" "5.2"
# View the legend on the epa website for the names of these ecoregions.
```

Now that we have extracted what ecoregion codes contain at least one species occurrence, we can mask the ecoregion raster to only contain those selected above.

```{r}
ecoNA_cor <- terra::subset(ecoNA, ecoNA$NA_L2CODE %in% eco_cor_code) # subset ecoregion spat vector by the codes

plot(ecoNA_cor) # plot the subsetted M. coronaria ecoregions
points(occThin_cor, pch = 3, col = 'red') # plot M. coronaria points
```

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width= '600px'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("C:/Users/terre/Documents/UBC/Botanical Garden/Malus Project/maps/eco regions/cor_eco.jpeg"))
```

And as always we want to save this intermidate object as a `.Rdata` file, so that we do not need to repeat the long computational step of extracting the ecoregions.

```{r}
setwd('../occ_data/eco_regions')
saveRDS(ecoNA_cor, file = 'ecoNA_cor.Rdata')
```

Now we can use these ecoregion rasters to crop our predictor climatic rasters. Again we are doing this so that we can define the study extent and sample the enviromental background. Make sure to set the `mask` argument equal to `TRUE`.

```{r}
# crop+mask extent of WorldClim data to the Malus ecoregions
wclim_cor <- terra::crop(wclim, ecoNA_cor, mask = T)

# Save cropped wclim data for downsteam SDM workflow
saveRDS(wclim_cor, file = 'wclim_cor.Rdata')
```

Now we want to randomly sample background points, and store the associated predictor values as SpatVectors. Alternatively you could also use SpatRasters if you please, but I found SpatVectors easier to work with. 

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: How many background points should be sampled? There is not a set default, althought it is common in some studies to see 5000 or 10000 background points. We made the decision to sample **20000 points** due to the very large spatial extent of this study. With this many points we can feel confident we the background enviroment is adequately sampled. Note that this is random, and has not yet adressed any spatial biases that may arise when modeling backgrounds (this is foreshadowing).

```{r}
set.seed(1337) # set a seed to ensure reproducible results

# NOTE: Set arguments as.raster = T to return raster
# OR as.points to return spatvector = T to return spatvector

# M. coronaria background
# SpatVector

# Note upped bg points from 5000 to 20000 to be more suitable to better reflect a mean probability of presence 1 - a/2

cor_bg_vec <- spatSample(wclim_cor, 20000, 'random', na.rm = T, as.points = T) #ignore NA values
plot(wclim_cor[[1]])
points(cor_bg_vec, cex = 0.01)
```

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width= '600px'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("C:/Users/terre/Documents/UBC/Botanical Garden/Malus Project/maps/eco regions/cor_bg.jpeg"))
```

We can also measure how many km^2 these ecoregions comprise, to get an idea of how many samples are taken per km^2.

```{r}
expanse(wclim_cor[[1]], unit = 'km') # total area of raster in km^2
# 5683684 km^2
20000/5683684
# 0.00035 samples/km
```

Annnnd you guessed it, we want to save these SpatVectors of background points for downsteam workflow.

```{r}
# Save background SpatVectors
setwd("../occ_data/")
saveRDS(cor_bg_vec, file = 'cor_bg_vec.Rdata')
```

You also may want to extract the actual predictor values and put them into a `data.frame` for both the occurrence points and background points. To do this you can again make use of the `terra::extract` function like above, and the `terra::values` function to get the values from the already bg SpatVectors. I show both as it can be useful, but I use mainly the SpatVectors downsteam.

```{r}
# Extracting presence-background raster values
cor_predvals <- extract(wclim_cor, occThin_cor) # M. coronaria
cor_predvals <- cor_predvals[-1] # drop ID column

cor_bgvals <- values(cor_bg_vec) # Extract raster values for bg points
```
Now we can create and save a `data.frame` which may come in handy later.

```{r}
