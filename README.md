UBC Botanical Garden is advancing action for adaptation through the development of community-based adaptation plans with the Sustainable Communities Field School. Ensuring the long-term preservation and sustainable utilization of apple genetic diversity across Canada is of paramount importance. This collaborative initiative aims to inventory and understand existing apple genetic diversity within the country. Additionally, it seeks to investigate how the suitability of habitats for apples may be affected by changing climatic conditions and emerging challenges. In response to these potential impacts, the project aims to identify urgent and longer-term adaptation strategies necessary for the continued resilience of apple populations in Canada.

This work is associated with a in-progress manuscript on *Malus* crop wild relatives (CWR) that are native to Canada, including *M. coronaria* (Sweet Crabapple) and *M. fusca* (Pacific Crabapple)

Visit <https://terrellroulston.github.io/malus/> for a reproducible workflow for the development of species distribution models (SDMs), using presence/background occurrence data for *M. coronaria* and *M. fusca* crabapple tree species.
